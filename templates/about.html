            <label>Chest Pain Type (cp)</label>
            <p>A classification of the patient's chest pain.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0 (Typical Angina):</strong> Chest pain related to reduced blood flow to the heart, typically induced by exertion.</li>
                <li><strong>1 (Atypical Angina):</strong> Chest pain that is less typical of angina.</li>
                <li><strong>2 (Non-anginal Pain):</strong> Chest pain not believed to be heart-related.</li>
                <li><strong>3 (Asymptomatic):</strong> No chest pain reported.</li>

            <label>Exercise Induced Angina (exang)</label>

            <label>Oldpeak (ST Depression)</label>
            <p>ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. This is a key measurement from an EKG that indicates heart stress.</p>

        <div class="about-item">
            <label>ST Slope</label>
            <p>The slope of the peak exercise ST segment on the EKG.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0 (Upsloping):</strong> ST segment is sloping upwards.</li>
                <li><strong>1 (Flat):</strong> ST segment is horizontal (flat).</li>
                <li><strong>2 (Downsloping):</strong> ST segment is sloping downwards.</li>

            <label>Number of Major Vessels (ca)</label>
            <p>The number of major coronary arteries (from 0 to 3) found to be narrowed or blocked, as identified by fluoroscopy (a type of X-ray).</p>

        <div class="about-item">
            <label>Thalassemia (thal)</label>
            <p>Results from a thallium stress test, which measures blood flow to the heart muscle.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 (Fixed Defect):</strong> A portion of the heart muscle shows no blood flow both at rest and after exercise (likely scar tissue).</li>
                <li><strong>2 (Normal):</strong> Normal blood flow.</li>
                <li><strong>3 (Reversible Defect):</strong> Reduced blood flow during exercise that becomes normal at rest (indicates a blockage).</li>
            </ul>
